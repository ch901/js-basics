Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.
undefined value is typically set by the JavaScript engine when a variable is declared but not assigned with any values.
null value is typically set by programmers when they want to assign an empty/blank value.
